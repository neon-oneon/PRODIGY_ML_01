This is a repo for the first task of Prodigy Infotech Machine Learning Internship. 

Attached is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and steps to acheive the output. 

The aim of the task is to perform Linear Regression on a dataset to predict the house prices based on the number of bathrooms and bedrooms in a house. 

The dataset used is found in Kaggle [here]([relative/path/to/new/page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)).
